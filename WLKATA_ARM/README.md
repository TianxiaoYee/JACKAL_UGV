It is recommended to "home" zero position the robot arm before use. This can be done by clicking on the HOMING button in blue in the top right corner.

### Step 2 Software
On the beelink mini pc, open the WLKATA IDE application
Go to the drawing section of the IDE.
Here you will have to manually setup the pen height that will be used for drawing. Make sure that the pen is clearly touching the paper, 
but still has enough force to move the pen around.
The pen height must be setup correctly as it will have significant impact on the result of the drawing.

### Step 3 Drawing
To draw text, type what you want in the write section on the right. Once pressed add, it will show up on the screen like so.
It is recommended to use font that is relatively skinny and to have the text be slightly larger than shown in the picture for the best results.
